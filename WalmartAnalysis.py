In this section, we present key metrics for Walmart's performance, including total inventory levels, forecasted demand, and actual demand. These metrics are essential to understanding the alignment of inventory with customer demand, providing insights into stock management and sales optimization. 

- **Total Inventory Level**: The inventory across the five stores analyzed amounts to over 1.2 million units, which indicates that Walmart has significant resources stocked.
- **Forecasted Demand**: The forecast predicts a total demand of approximately 1.5 million units, highlighting expected consumer purchases.
- **Actual Demand**: In comparison, the actual demand slightly exceeds the forecast, totaling around 1.5 million units. This small variance shows that Walmart's forecasting model is fairly accurate.
